      text: `Rumor has it,
That you have got a thing for me.
That you care.
But we both know that,
There is no smoke without fire.

I know you watch me,
Every time I walk by.
Without looking,
I can feel the smile.
I look your way,
And you tried to hide.

From your blushing eyes,
I know you are mine.
Your deep brown eyes,
And your dazzling white teeth.
From your beautiful smile,
That is just for me.

I wonder if we can be,
A perfect you and me.
Let's write a love story,
That will last for eternity.

Rumor has it,
That you have got a thing for me,
That you care.
But we both know that,
There is no smoke without fire.

      text: `When the morning comes,
And the love is gone.
I see your face in the sky.
I see the future of us,
In the horizon.
And I know somebody's gonna cry.

As the love slowly fades,
And I don't want to wait,
Wallowing in this pain.
Though it may sound cruel,
When lovers sing the blues.
But I know, somebody's gonna cry.

You fit the perfect profile.
That I cannot deny.

Is it love at first sight?
Oh, I hope I am right.

Things have not been the same,
Since the day we met.

You have been the only thing on my mind,
Morning, noon, and night.

Do we have to play the game?
Or will you just tell me your name?

Would we be happy?
Am I really that lucky?

And its venom is slowly killing me.

Burning through my veins cruel,

I have swallowed the bitter fruit of love,
And its poison is cutting my intestines up.

Why does love bring tears to my eyes?
Why does it make me want to end my life?

Oh, love, why love? Why me?
Why are you so unkind to me?

Haven't you punished me enough?
Isn't it time you left me alone?

More precious than all the jewels in the world,
Diamond and gold.

More and more.

Loving you is what I will do,
Forevermore.
You are the only one in my heart, I owe you, my life.
Loving you gives me joy.
Makes me a better person,
And gave me a reason to live.

Don't ever leave me, baby,
I will never leave you.
Even if it cost me my life…….
Baby, don't you see, there are only two answers to a question,
Yes and no.
But when it comes to our love, there is no
Yes or no.

I will love you with my body,
Heart and soul.
Because to me, there will never be another like you,
No, no.

How we didn’t start on a good note.
I hated you then because I didn’t know how amazing you were.

This morning, I woke up and you weren’t by my side.
Not there to kiss my lips and tickle my toes.
Now you are gone, and I don’t know what to do.
You took my entire happiness with you.

Sadness is my daily companion.
Now I know why they say, love is pain.
I never thought I’d miss you this much……
Even though I know you are the best thing that ever happened to me,
Because I took you for granted,

Never knew you’d leave someday.
Wherever you are whatever you do.
I hope I am still on your mind. Because you know,
I’ll never forget you. Not in my whole lifetime.


Chorus:
Gone are the days when the sun used to shine on my face.
Now all is cold because you are gone from my life.
Oh, how I miss you………..
Oh, I miss the feeling of you
being close to me.

They say, you never know
what you’ve got until it’s
gone.
Oh, how true that is, because
now I see,
That life without you is
torture.
Wishing I’d bring back those

A nose so high up,

Features so beautiful,

And an expression so elusive,
It is pure darkness.

Like Siamese twins, we have each other’s back.
Always by my side, the best friend I have ever had.

He has sixteen friends of his own.
That means all my enemies be gone.

The first and last thing you see.
Like my shadow, always with me.

He listens to no one but me.
When he talks, everyone listens.

When he comes out, everyone runs.
Cross his path and he will make you famous.

Every message he sends hits home.
I give it up for Mr. Johns.

Flashed a smile like 350 watts.
